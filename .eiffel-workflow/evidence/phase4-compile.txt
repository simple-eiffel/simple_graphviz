# Phase 4 Implementation Evidence
# Project: d:\prod\simple_graphviz
# Date: 2026-01-22

## Implementation Summary

### Task 1: GRAPHVIZ_RENDERER Core Rendering - COMPLETE
- is_graphviz_available: Executes "dot -V", checks was_successful
- graphviz_version: Parses "version X.Y.Z" from dot -V output
- is_version_sufficient: Compares major.minor >= 2.40
- render: Writes temp file, executes with timeout, reads output
- render_to_file: Writes temp file, executes directly to output path
- Timeout via SIMPLE_ASYNC_PROCESS.wait_seconds
- Error classification: graphviz_not_found, timeout, invalid_dot, output_error
- Temp file cleanup implemented

### Task 2: Documentation Notes - COMPLETE
- DOT_SUBGRAPH.make_cluster: cluster_ prefix note added
- DOT_GRAPH.add_edge: implicit node creation note added
- All 5 builder classes: MML at DOT_GRAPH level note added

### Tasks 3-5: Source Parsing - DEFERRED
- Requires simple_eiffel_parser and simple_xml integration
- Stub implementations remain (return Current)
- Can be implemented in future phase when parsers are ready

### Task 6: Frame Conditions - COMPLETE
- Added notes to render/render_to_file about external side-effect nature
- Postconditions already ensure result_not_void

### Task 7: Integration Tests - PARTIAL
- Skeletal tests exist, but depend on GraphViz being installed
- Need actual execution with GraphViz to verify
