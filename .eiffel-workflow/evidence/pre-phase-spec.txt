# Pre-Phase Specification Evidence
# Project: simple_graphviz
# Date: 2026-01-22

Specification completed: yes
Steps completed: 8/8
Classes designed: 10
Contracts defined: 50+
Requirements traced: 17/17

OOSC2 compliance: PASS
Eiffel excellence: PASS
Ready for implementation: yes

Classes:
  1. SIMPLE_GRAPHVIZ (facade)
  2. DOT_GRAPH (graph structure)
  3. DOT_NODE (node structure)
  4. DOT_EDGE (edge structure)
  5. DOT_SUBGRAPH (cluster structure)
  6. DOT_ATTRIBUTES (attribute helper)
  7. GRAPHVIZ_RENDERER (subprocess engine)
  8. GRAPHVIZ_RESULT (result object)
  9. GRAPHVIZ_STYLE (style presets)
  10. BON_DIAGRAM_BUILDER (AST adapter)

Dependencies:
  - simple_mml (MML postconditions)
  - simple_eiffel_parser (parse .e files)
  - simple_process (subprocess)
  - simple_file (file I/O)
  - simple_pdf (PDF export, optional)
  - base (ISE)

Key Design Decisions:
  - Subprocess pattern via simple_process (not native binding)
  - Structured DOT builder (not string templates)
  - BON-inspired with flexibility (configurable styles)
  - Layered architecture with facade
