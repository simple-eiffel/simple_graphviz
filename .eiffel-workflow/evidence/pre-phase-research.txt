# Pre-Phase Research Evidence
# Project: simple_graphviz
# Date: 2026-01-22

Research completed: yes
Steps completed: 7/7
Recommendation: BUILD
Confidence: HIGH

References cited: 25+
Alternatives researched: 5 (GraphViz, EiffelStudio, EBON, Python graphviz, ts-graphviz)
Risks identified: 11

Key Findings:
- No existing Eiffel library for DOT/GraphViz integration
- Subprocess pattern proven in simple_pdf
- simple_eiffel_parser provides structural info
- BON notation well-documented
- GraphViz handles layout complexity
- AI integration deferred (no clear value for MVP)

Dependencies Identified:
- simple_eiffel_parser (Eiffel parsing)
- simple_process (subprocess)
- simple_file (I/O)
- simple_pdf (PDF export)
- GraphViz (external, must be installed)

Architecture:
- Layered: DOT AST -> Renderer -> BON Builder -> Facade
- ~10 classes estimated
- Fluent builder pattern

# Status: COMPLETE
